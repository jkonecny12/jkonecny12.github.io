Title: Debugging and testing of Anaconda
Date: 2017-16-09
Category: Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda) is a quite complex project with many dependencies on variety of libraries but also system dependencies like kernel and storage libraries. Aside of that, which makes situation even worse, are installation mods. There are graphical (GUI), text (TUI) but also mods like fully and partial automatic text or graphical, or non-interactive mod. Anaconda can be run locally too to create an installation media.
Thanks to this complexity it is not an easy task to just do the required changes and run the Anaconda. To test Anaconda properly it's required to run plenty of times with all the modifications. Anaconda is supported on plenty of platforms so to have a **really** good feeling that everything is tested then the test should have been done on all the supported platforms, including IBM Z systems or Power PC. And yes, not even developers are able to handle that so for most of the common changes a plain x64 VM is the reasonable solution.

To address this issue, we (Anaconda developers) are investing a quite amount of our time to make this situation better. For example we are working on the Anaconda [modularization effort](https://rhinstaller.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/anaconda-modularisation/). Thanks to this effort developer can is able to connect to modules and play with them. We have also an automatic installations tests named [kickstart tests](https://github.com/rhinstaller/kickstart-tests). These two are special for Anaconda solutions for testing but we of course have a unit tests and tests if the RPMs are created correctly.

In this article I want to give you basic information on why it is so hard to make changes to Anaconda but also to create a short tutorial how to do Anaconda development properly. I will describe useful methods to get your changes into the installation environment and how to test it easily with all your required use cases. Because this topic is quite a big I will split it into a few articles.

# Updates image

Probably an every developer who contributed a slightly complex code to Anaconda development have heard about the updates images. The updates images are the basic tool used on everyday basis to test changes targeted to Anaconda. By updates image you can replace any file in the installation environment. You can replace for example sshd configuration file in the /etc directory or any source file of Anaconda. Thanks to the fact that Anaconda is almost completely Python language it is easy to just replace source specific source files before Anaconda is launched.

To apply updates image you need to add [inst.updates](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boot-options.html#inst-updates) on the kernel boot parameters or you can add the link to the [kickstart file](https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html#updates). Both solutions should have the same result. Please follow the links above to find out more.

In the core an updates image is just an image created by the cpio and pigz utilities. No magic at all. There is a few options to create the updates image.

## Manually

You can easily create an updates image from the command line:

```
find . | cpio -c -o | pigz -9cv > ../updates.img
```

When this is called all the content in the current directory will be placed into the updates image. File paths relative from this directory will be preserved in the installation environment, e.g. `./etc/ssh/sshd_config` will replace `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in the installation environment. This solution is an easy way how to create an updates image but it is not that nice to add changed files from Anaconda or other advanced use cases.


## Creating updates image by `makeupdates` script

Because we are recreating updates image many, many times a day we have tools to make our life easier. The most important one is [makeupdates](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/master/scripts/makeupdates) script in the Anaconda repository. This script will add every changed file from some point in the git history. The script has additional features like adding RPM package content to the updates image. Iâ€™ll now describe the most interesting features you can do with this script.

### Basic usage

```
./scripts/makeupdates --tag HEAD
```

Add all files which were not committed yet to the updates image.

```
./scripts/makeupdates --tag anaconda-29.1.1-1
```
Add all files changed since the commit with the anaconda-29.1.1-1 git tag was created.

Readers familiar with the git already know that `--tag` parameter accept anything which can be used to specify commit in a git and add all the files changed from that point to the actual state. That means you can specify version tag e.g. `anaconda-31.25.2-1` or `HEAD~`.

### Add custom RPM

From time to time there is a need to get more than just parts of the Anaconda to the updates image but instead some custom files or libraries. Even for this reason you can use the `makeupdates` script.

```
./scripts/makeupdates --tag HEAD --add /path/to/my/first.rpm --add /path/to/my/second.rpm
```

This is an easy way how to add a custom RPM file to the installation environment. However, there are drawbacks to this solution.

1) RPM scriptlets are not launched in this case. 

RPM scriptlets are scripts in the rpm file which are run when some action occurred (for example installation of the RPM). Reason why this is happening is that these RPM files are not installed to the updates image but only unpacked. For most cases that is totally fine but for some you can get unexpected results of missing files, bad dependencies, bad configuration...

2) Prone to accidentally add Anaconda files to the updates image.

You have to run the script with the `--tag` parameter which will add all changed files (based on the value) to the updates image. If this happen then the installation may crash at some point because you are loading invalid files into the installation environment. This is caused by the unfortunate design of the makeupdates script.

### Add custom files

By using the `makeupdates` script there is a possibility to add basically any content. This way it's possible to add or replace any file in the installation environment.

```
./scripts/makeupdates --tag HEAD --keep
```

The `--keep` parameter will prevent the script to remove the folder after use. After running this command you will see the `updates` directory in the root Anaconda directory. You can then create any directory or any file in the `updates` directory and then run the above command again to create new updates image with the desired content. This can be done as many times as needed the `updates` directory won't be erased until the `--keep` parameter is used. Example of this use case is:

```
$ ./scripts/makeupdates --tag HEAD --keep

$ mkdir -p ./updates/etc/ssh
$ cp /my/custom/config ./updates/etc/ssh/sshd_config

$ ./scripts/makeupdates --tag HEAD --keep
```

This is an example how to change ssh configuration of the booted installation.

## Using wrapper around makeupdates

Aside of the *official* `makeupdates` script in the Anaconda git, there is a possibility to use [anaconda-updates](https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/tree/master/anaconda_updates) wrapper. This script was created to simplify work with different Anaconda versions. This wrapper was designed to avoid writing user custom scripts, these scripts were written by almost everyone who used `makeupdates` script to for example upload resulting updates image for use in VM.

The following steps are required to be prepare environment for using `anaconda-updates`.

* Create a configuration file

The configuration file is part of the git repository of the anaconda updates, see [link](https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/blob/master/anaconda_updates/updates.cfg). Copy this configuration file into `~/.config/anaconda-updates/updates.cfg` and fill up the values there. This configuration file will specify where is your Anaconda folder, where is the show version script (see below) and also access information to the server where the updates image should be uploaded. The last part is really helpful to ease application of the updates image to the test machine, the drawback is that you have to available server with ssh access.

* Adapt the show version script

In the git repository there is also a [script](https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/blob/master/anaconda_updates/scripts/show_version.sh) which is responsible to get information about the current anaconda rpm file version. This script have to be updated (or written from a scratch if desired) to be applicable to your environment. See the script and make required changes.


When the steps above are completed you can start using this wrapper. The main benefits are that it is not required to use tags but rather the updates image will be created for the Anaconda rpm version (`--master` paramater), this also works for released fedora (`--fedoraXX` for fedora version). The automatic upload to the server to help faster the development and debugging cycles is a nice feature. Use of this wrapper script is pretty easy and I'm adding fixed Anaconda version on already released Fedora.

# Future improvements

We are planning to promote the `makeupdates` script to a standalone script which will provide much of the current benefit but with better user experience. The main change will be to move the functionality of the `makeupdates` script out of the Anaconda source code. We are trying to solve problem that the script usage is not compatible for all version and it could be problematic to start the old Anaconda version (RHEL-6/7) scripts on newer Fedora systems. Instead of having this script in different versions of Anaconda code base we will provide one script and Anaconda code base will provide a configuration file for this script. This will probably deprecate current [anaconda-updates](https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/tree/master/anaconda_updates) wrapper script because there won't be any need for that. The new script will have the benefit to be easily extended so it can adapt all the current features of the `anaconda-updates`.

Aside of that we also want to provide users default working configuration and separation from the Anaconda code base. That means that the script will be usable from the `git clone` call and all the setting will be only optional. It could be even packaged to Fedora if users would like to have it there. We will try to find the best defaults for users. The separation will give the possibility to just add a custom content without any requirement from the Anaconda source code. That will make use of the script much easier for people who want to debug something not related to Anaconda in the installation environment (for example why some RPM can't be installed).


Thanks everyone for your focus and if you have an idea for further improvement please write a comment. They are really valuable to us.
